## 📃 Idea in brief: Question to be resolved and why
### 💥 Problem
There are a number of light coughs which people will generally have anyway. We need to know which of these are Covid-19, and which are not.
If built into a phone app, we also have the capacity of using GPS Data to track the spread.

### 👨‍🔬Hypothesis
That audio analysis will present an approach to identify coronavirus coughs.

### 🤔 Assumptions
That we can identify which coughs are likely caused by the Coronavirus. 

* There will inevitably be a number of errors of type I and type II - so we will ideally need to create a confidence measure, though it is suggested that, in the short term, this is not presented to the user.

## 💻Implementation Suggestion

### V1
First, we need to develop a dataset of coughs, and of Covid-19 coughs. There are some initial resources we can gather, and develop a first stage test. 

In parallel, we need a phone app development that would allow us to gather a few seconds of audio recording and parse it, ideally locally on the device, and gather some basic data regarding the individual using it. (I know little about app development, is anyone willing to lead on this?)

### What it is
(what are we testing and the hypothesis we’re testing)

### What it is not
(what we’re saying no to)

### Design
(Screenshot/drawing/link)

### Data/Experiments
(Detail all the things about the experiment/trial setting especially any data requirements)

V2 (..repeat the process)
